# Python has several plotting libraries, but [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a common tool for 2D plotting, particularly the `matplotlib.pyplot` sub-module.
# 
# **Learning Objectives**
# 
# - Understand how to use `matplotlib` to plot data (especially `numpy` arrays)
# - See common plot styles, inclduing from `seaborn` which uses `matplotlib` to do its work

# Let's get started by importing `matplotlib.pyplot` and using `%matplotlib` [Jupyter magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-matplotlib) to display plots in the notebook.

# In[1]:


# import the key parts of matplotlib with the common abbreviation `plt`
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# tell matplotlib and Jupyter to include plots inline - in the notebook
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
# make the inline backend include high-resolution 'retina' plots on high-res screens
# not critical, but it makes a huge difference if you have a good screen
get_ipython().run_line_magic('config', "InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'")


# That bit above (and similar versions) is "boilerplate" - I just copy and paste it to create plots, e.g.:
# 
# ```
# # import numpy and matplotlib
# import numpy as np
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# # insert plots in the notebook
# %matplotlib inline
# %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'
# # bump up the font sizes
# ```

# ## Basic Plotting
# 
# ### Procedure
# 
# The general procedure to create a 2D line plot is:
# 
# 1. Create a sequence of $x$ values.
# 2. Create a sequence of $y$ values.
# 3. Enter `plt.plot(x,y,[fmt],**kwargs)` 
#   - where `[fmt]` is an optional format string
#   - `**kwargs` are optional keyword arguments specifying line properties of the plot
# 4. Use `pyplot` functions to add features to the figure such as a title, legend, grid lines, etc.
# 5. Enter `plt.show()` to display the resulting figure.
# 
# Some code uses [format strings](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot.html) like 'ro', but it's generally easier to read and understand the keyword options, as discussed below.
# 
# Let's begin with a basic example with a few random points:

# In[2]:


x = [-5,-2,0,1,3]
y = [2,-1,1,-4,3]
plt.plot(x,y)


# The main things to notice are:
# 
# 1. The sequences `x` and `y` define the coordinates of the points in the plot.
# 2. The line in the plot is constructed by connecting the points by straight lines.
# 
# The second observation implies that if we want to plot a smooth curve then we need to plot lots of points otherwise the plot will not be smooth. For example, we could try plotting the parabola $y = x^2$ for $x$ from -2 .. 2 using only 5 points:

# In[3]:


import numpy as np

x = np.array([-2,-1,0,1,2])
y = x**2
plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()


# This is too few points to plot a smooth curve such as $y = x^2$ and so we need more points! Let's try again using the NumPy function `np.linspace` to create 100 points!

# In[4]:


import numpy as np # we haven't done that yet in this notebook

x = np.linspace(-2,2,100000) # remember, this creates an array from -2 to +2 with 100 divisions (and includes both Â±2)
y = x**2
plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()


# That's a better representation of the parabola $y = x^2$. Note that the number of points we use in a line plot (100 in this case) is completely arbitrary but the goal is to show a smooth graph for a smooth curve and so we just need to pick a big enough number depending on the function. But be careful not to generate too many points since a *very* large number of points will take a *long* time to plot!
# 
# Instead of `np.linspace()` we could use `np.arange(start, end, resolution)` to set up our `x` variable.. read them in from a file, write them by hand.. it doesn't matter much. We just need to make sure we have `x` and `y` arrays that are the same length.

# ### Line Properties
# 
# A line appearing in a plot has several properties including color, transparency, style, width and markers. We can set these properties when we call `plt.plot` using the following keyword arguments:
# 
# | Property | Description |
# | :---: | :--- |
# | `alpha` | transparency (0.0 transparent through 1.0 opaque) |
# | `color` (or `c`) | any matplotlib color |
# | `label` | text appearing in legend |
# | `linestyle` (or `ls`) | `solid`, `dashed`, `dashdot`, `dotted` |
# | `linewidth` (or `lw`) | set width of the line |
# | `marker` | set marker style |
# | `markeredgecolor` (or `mec`) | any matplotlib color |
# | `markerfacecolor` (or `mfc`) | any matplotlib color |
# | `markersize` (or `ms`) | size of the marker |
# 
# Note that we can specify a [matplotlib color](https://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html) in several different ways including by name such as `blue` or `red`, or by a [RGB](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp) tuple such as `(1,0,1)` for purple. For example, let's plot the function
# 
# $$
# y = e^{-x^2}\cos(2 \pi x) \ \ , \ \ x \in [-2,2]
# $$

# In[5]:


x = np.linspace(-2,2,41) # range of 4, so 0.1 resolution, plus one to ensure we get -2 and +2
y = np.exp(-x**2) * np.cos(2*np.pi*x)

plt.plot(x,y,alpha=0.4,label='Decaying Cosine',
         color='red',linestyle='dashed',linewidth=2,
         marker='o',markersize=5,markerfacecolor='blue',
         markeredgecolor='blue')
plt.ylim(-2, 2) # set the limits on the y-axis to -2,2
plt.legend() #show the plot legend
plt.show()


# Notice that we used the pyplot function `plt.legend` to display the figure with a legend (showing the line label) and  and `plt.ylim` to set the limits on the vertical axis to `[-2,2]`.

# Another example:
# 
# $$
# y = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \ , \ x \in [-5,5]
# $$
# 
# with a dashed black line and square markers:

# In[6]:


x = np.linspace(-5,5,41)
y = 1/(1 + x**2)

plt.plot(x,y,color='black',linestyle='dashed',marker='s')
plt.savefig('figure.pdf')


# Format strings can be used as a shorthand, e.g. `'ks--'` where `k` denotes a black line, `s` a square marker and `--` a dashed line.

# ### Pyplot Functions
# 
# There are many `pyplot` functions available for us to customize our figures. For example:
# 
# | Fucntion | Description |
# | ---: | :--- |
# | `plt.xlim` | set $x$ limits |
# | `plt.ylim` | set $y$ limits |
# | `plt.xscale` | set $x$ scale, e.g. "linear", "log", "symlog" |
# | `plt.yscale` | set $y$ scale, e.g. "linear", "log", "symlog" |
# | `plt.xlabel` | add label to the horizontal axis |
# | `plt.ylabel` | add label to the vertical axis |
# | `plt.xticks` | set tick locations on the horizontal axis |
# | `plt.yticks` | set tick locations on the vertical axis |
# | `plt.grid` | add grid lines |
# | `plt.title` | add a title |
# | `plt.axis` | set axis properties (`equal`, `off`, `scaled`, etc.) |
# | `plt.legend` | display legend for several lines in the same figure |
# | `plt.savefig` | save figure (as .png, .pdf, etc.) to working directory |
# | `plt.figure` | create a new figure and set its properties |
# 
# See the [pyplot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html) for a full list of functions.

# ### Examples
# 
# We can also include more than one plot in a figure. We just call `plt.plot()` more than once before `plt.show()`.
# 
# Indeed, that's part of the point of `matplotlib.pyplot` - you build up a set of commands that modifies the figure before `plt.show()` turns it into a graphic.

# In[7]:


x = np.arange(-3.0, 3.0, 0.1) # notice that this leaves off 3.0
y1 = -x**2 + 2*x - 1
y2 = x**2 + 2*x + 0.75

plt.plot(x, y1, color='black')
plt.plot(x, y2, color='red')

plt.ylim(-4,4) # set the limit on the y-axis to -4 .. 4


# ### Taylor Polynomials
# 
# Plot the function $y = \cos(x)$ along with its [Taylor polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) of degrees 2 and 4.

# In[8]:


x = np.linspace(-6,6,50)

# Plot y = cos(x)
y = np.cos(x)
plt.plot(x,y,'b',label='cos(x)')

# Plot degree 2 Taylor polynomial
y2 = 1 - x**2/2
plt.plot(x,y2,color='red',label='Degree 2')

# Plot degree 4 Taylor polynomial
y4 = 1 - x**2/2 + x**4/24
plt.plot(x,y4,color='green',label='Degree 4')

# Add features to our figure
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True,linestyle=':')
plt.xlim([-6,6])
plt.ylim([-4,4])
plt.title('Taylor Polynomials of cos(x) at x=0')
plt.xlabel('x values')
plt.ylabel('y values')

plt.show()


# ### Subplots
# 
# The `plt.subplot` can be used to create arrays of plots. The function takes at least 3 inputs $n$, $m$ and $i$ and creates a figure with a $n$ by $m$ grid of subplots and then sets the $i$th subplot (counting across the rows) as the current plot (ie. current axes object).
# 
# For example, consider the [sawtooth wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave)
# 
# $$
# f(t) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^k \frac{\sin(2 \pi k t)}{k}
# $$
# 
# and let $f_N(t)$ denote the $N$th partial sum of the sawtooth wave:
# 
# $$
# f_N(t) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{k=1}^{N} (-1)^k \frac{\sin(2 \pi k t)}{k}
# $$
# 
# Create a 2 by 2 grid of subplots to plot the first 4 partial sums:
# 
# \begin{align}
# f_1(t) &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sin(2 \pi t)}{\pi} \\\
# f_2(t) &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sin(2 \pi t)}{\pi} - \frac{\sin(4 \pi t)}{2\pi} \\\
# f_3(t) &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sin(2 \pi t)}{\pi} - \frac{\sin(4 \pi t)}{2\pi} + \frac{\sin(6 \pi t)}{3\pi} \\\
# f_4(t) &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sin(2 \pi t)}{\pi} - \frac{\sin(4 \pi t)}{2\pi} + \frac{\sin(6 \pi t)}{3\pi} - \frac{\sin(8 \pi t)}{4\pi}
# \end{align}

# In[9]:


t = np.linspace(0,4,200)

fN = 1/2
for N in [1,2,3,4]:
    fN = fN - (-1)**N * np.sin(2*N*np.pi*t)/(N*np.pi)
    plt.subplot(2,2,N)
    plt.plot(t,fN)
    plt.title('N = {}'.format(N))

plt.tight_layout() # adds some space between the subplots
plt.show()


# ## Scatter plots
# 
# A [scatter plot](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html) has 4 dimensions: $x$ coordinate, $y$ coordinate, and optionally size and color. Let's make a random scatter plot:

# In[10]:


# Set the number of dots in the plot
N = 200

# Create N different random x and y coordinates sampled uniformly from [0,1]
x = np.random.rand(N)
y = np.random.rand(N)

# Create random array sampled uniformly from [5,25]
# `size` array is used below to set the size of each dot
size = 20*np.random.rand(N) + 5

# Create a figure of size 12 by 5 and create scatter plot
# plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
plt.scatter(x,y,s=size)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()


# ### Histograms
# 
# Generate an array of 5000 random numbers sampled from the normal distribution and create a [histogram](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html). Let's also superimpose the normal distribution:
# 
# $$
# y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}
# $$

# In[11]:


samples = np.random.randn(5000)

# bins = 20 (i.e., 20 equal-sized bins)
# density = True means the histogram will be rescaled to reflect the total # of samples
plt.hist(samples,bins=20, density=True, alpha=0.5, color=(0.3,0.8,0.1))
plt.title('Random Samples - Normal Distribution')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')

# second plot, adding a Gaussian curve by evaluating x, y across -4 to +4
x = np.linspace(-4,4,100)
y = 1/(2*np.pi)**0.5 * np.exp(-x**2/2)
plt.plot(x,y, alpha=0.8)

plt.show()
